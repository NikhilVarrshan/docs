We advise keeping your company-issued computer, tablet, and cell phone secure. You can do this if you:

- Keep all devices password-protected.
- Ensure you do not leave your devices unattended.
- Install security updates for browsers and other systems as soon as updates are available.
- Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only.
- Follow all instructions for disk encryption, anti-malware protection, and password management you received with your equipment.
