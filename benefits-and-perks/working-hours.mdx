title: "8.7 Working hours & Attendance"
---

**1. Standard Working Hours**

The Company operates Monday to Friday, between 09:00 and 18:00 IST, excluding Company-declared holidays.

Employees are expected to report to the office by 09:00 IST unless otherwise approved.

**2. Workweek Requirement**

The standard workweek consists of 48 hours of productive work.

These hours represent actual, meaningful work contribution, not mere physical presence or system login time.

Lunch breaks and non-work activities are excluded from productive hours.

**3. Attendance & Punctuality**

Consistent punctuality is mandatory.

Repeated late arrivals, unexplained absences, or failure to meet work expectations may be treated as misconduct.

Employees are expected to plan their commute and schedules responsibly.

**4. Completion of Daily Work Requirements / After-Hours Work**

The Company measures work based on productive output, not mere physical presence or system login time.

Employees are expected to complete approximately 9.5 hours of productive work per working day, forming part of the standard 48-hour workweek.

If an employee does not complete the required productive work during standard working hours due to inefficiency, distraction, late arrival, or misuse of time, the reporting manager may require the employee to continue working beyond standard office hours on the same day or during the same workweek in order to complete assigned responsibilities.

Such additional time spent does not constitute overtime, provided it is used solely to fulfill the employee’s standard workweek obligations and does not result in work exceeding 48 hours of actual productive work.

Overtime compensation will apply only where productive work performed exceeds the standard 48-hour workweek, and only where such excess work is:

expressly required by the Company, and

applicable under law or employment contract.

Employees are responsible for managing their time efficiently within standard hours. Managers are responsible for ensuring that after-hours work is used strictly to complete required deliverables and not as a substitute for proper workload planning.
