Our company operates between 0900 and 1800 hours except Saturdays and Sundays. Our timings are in IST.Â 

You are required to punch your attendance into the office at 0900 hours.

A delay in reporting to work on time will result in a reduction in compensation. The CEO personally does all special waive-offs on any reductions in compensation at his own discretion.

Some departments may work after hours, too, but this is based on inter-team coordination.

For all purposes, you must work 48 hours a week.
