title: "Remote Working"
---

Remote working refers to working from a non-office location temporarily or permanently. We do not encourage remote working owing to the nature of our work and our intense all-hands-on-deck-get-your-hands-dirty work culture.

If youâ€™re an office-based staff, you may work remotely for a maximum of two weeks per year taken consecutively or split into a week each. You may arrange this if you are a new parent or have a short-term disability.

If you have another reason, talk to your manager. Submit your remote working requests at least one week in advance so that your team can plan the same.
