title: "Company issued equipment"

You may receive company cell phones, laptops or other devices, and furniture as a staff member. Unless otherwise mentioned in your contract, any equipment we offer belongs to our company, and you may not sell it or give it away.Â 

You are also responsible for keeping our equipment safe and in good condition. If your equipment breaks or malfunctions, let us know so we can arrange to have it repaired. If it's a non-accidental break or malfunction that occurs due to an employee's irresponsibility, the repair cost will be recovered from the employee.

A separate device agreement will be signed for all employees who are given devices, which helps track whether the device is re-assigned to a different employee.

Please do not keep any personal data on your Zemuria-issued laptop. You should maintain a separate, personally owned machine if you need a home computer. The company reserves the right to and may be required to confiscate your laptop or its data at any point.
