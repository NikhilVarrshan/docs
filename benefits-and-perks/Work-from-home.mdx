title: "Work from home"
---

We uphold a policy of working from the office, which fosters high productivity and teamwork while promoting a healthy work-life balance. However, we understand that there may be excusable concerns that require a different approach. With your manager's consent, you can work from home occasionally (WFH).

- Please inform your CoS or your Manager at least two days in advance that you want to work from home. In a rare emergency, you may work from home without prior approval, but call or text your CoS/Manager as soon as possible.
- When working from home, it's important to maintain a sense of connection with your team. Please use a fast and secure internet connection and devices, and choose a workspace free from distractions. Regular check-ins with your team will make collaboration easier and keep you connected.
- If inclement weather (e.g., a cyclone) occurs, please check your Office Discord to see if the office is officially closed. Let us know if you judge that your commute during inclement weather is dangerous. We will not force you to come to work if your safety is at stake or there is an official travel warning.
