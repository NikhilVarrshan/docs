**4. Work From Home & Remote Work**

**4.1 General Position**

- The Company does not encourage remote or work-from-home arrangements.
- All forms of non-office work (WFH or remote) are treated under a single unified framework.

**4.2 Annual Limit**

- Employees may be permitted to work outside the office for a maximum of 14 days per calendar year.
- This is a maximum permissible limit, not a guaranteed entitlement.

1. recommendation from the reporting manager, and
2. explicit approval from HR.

Approval is discretionary and may be denied without obligation to provide justification.

**4.4 Emergency Situations**

1. In genuine emergencies (e.g., illness, unsafe travel conditions), employees must inform their manager and HR at the earliest possible time.
2. Emergency accommodation does not waive policy limits or expectations.

**4.5 Conditions While Working Outside the Office**

- Standard working hours and productivity expectations continue to apply.
- Employees must remain reachable and comply with all security and device-use policies.
- WFH/remote arrangements may be revoked at any time based on performance, misuse, or operational needs.
