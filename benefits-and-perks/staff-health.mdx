Staff health is important to us. We don’t discriminate against people with disabilities or health conditions but want to do everything possible to help our staff stay healthy. At a minimum, we provide group health insurance to all eligible staff. For more information about our insurance package, contact HR or Manager.

We have also established non-smoking and substance abuse policies to protect staff health. We will create a workplace with minimal noise and good lighting and offer a canteen service and wellness programs.

Zemuria is committed to supporting the health, safety, and well-being of its employees. As part of this commitment, eligible full-time employees based in India are covered under a comprehensive group health insurance program.

This program is designed to go beyond statutory requirements and to provide meaningful, practical medical coverage that supports employees and their families during periods of illness, emergency, or planned medical care.

### **Eligibility:**

This benefit is available only to full-time employees of Zemuria employed in India.

Contractors, interns, trainees, apprentices, consultants, and temporary staff are not eligible for employee health insurance benefits unless explicitly stated in their individual engagement contracts.

Health insurance coverage remains active only for the duration of active, full-time employment with the company.

### **Scope of Coverage (High-Level Overview)**

The group health insurance program generally includes coverage for the following categories, subject to the insurer’s policy terms:

- In-patient hospitalization and related medical expenses
- Pre- and post-hospitalization expenses within defined time windows
- Day-care and short-duration medical procedures
- Mental health and psychiatric hospitalization
- Maternity-related hospitalization and childbirth care
- Emergency transportation, including air ambulance in critical cases
- Organ donor medical expenses, where applicable
- Treatment under recognized alternative medicine systems (AYUSH)
- Coverage for certain modern and advanced medical treatments, as permitted under the policy

The program is structured to minimize restrictive sub-limits and exclusions where feasible, with the intent of providing broad and usable coverage rather than nominal benefits.

### **Policy Administration & Claims**

The health insurance program is administered through a third-party insurance provider.

All coverage details, inclusions, exclusions, claim procedures, service standards, and limitations are governed by the insurer’s official policy document.

The insurer’s policy terms shall prevail in the event of any discrepancy between this handbook and the insurance policy.

The Human Resources (HR) team serves as the primary point of contact for employees seeking guidance on enrollment, claims, documentation, or insurer coordination.

### **Employment Status & Coverage Termination**

Health insurance coverage is directly linked to active employment status.

Coverage typically ceases upon termination of employment, resignation, or completion of the employment term, in accordance with the insurer’s policy rules.

In exceptional circumstances, and at the company’s sole discretion, Zemuria may consider temporary continuation or support related to health coverage during a severance or transition period. Any such consideration is:

evaluated on a case-by-case basis,

time-bound,

non-precedent-setting,

and does not constitute a contractual entitlement or ongoing obligation.
