Staff health is important to us. We donâ€™t discriminate against people with disabilities or health conditions but want to do everything possible to help our staff stay healthy. At a minimum, we provide group health insurance to all eligible staff. For more information about our insurance package, contact CoS/HR/Manager.

We have also established non-smoking and substance abuse policies to protect staff health. We will create a workplace with minimal noise and good lighting and offer a canteen service and wellness programs.
