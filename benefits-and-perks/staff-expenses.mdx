You may be required to travel, whether in or around India or overseas, in connection with your contractual agreement with the Company upon short notice to you.

We will reimburse you for your expenses and costs while traveling for work and any other expenses incurred by you during the course of your contractual agreement, provided all bills and records are maintained only if they are pre-authorized to you in an email by the CoS/Management.

A limit for such expenses will also be set depending on the time and destination of travel.

The company may also provide you with an interest-free loan for extra expenses like house rent, emergencies, etc., during your employment.

Upon cessation of your contract/employment, the company is at will and entitled to either collect back, deduct from your final settlement/payroll, or even write it off at their discretion on good standing and release a No-Due Certificate.
