title: "Theft and damage to company equipment"

Our equipment is not insured for theft and damage. We ask you to inform us within 24 hours if your equipment is stolen or damaged.

Please also file a theft statement (affidavit) with the police and submit a copy within 48 hours. Absence of the same will be treated as personal misplacement, and you will be responsible for compensating the organization for the said theft or damage.
