Parking is provided for all Zemuria members. The office building administration staff or building security determines the parking place. We expect you to cooperate cordially and follow their instructions. We expect you to keep our parking lot clean. Please behave responsibly to avoid causing damage, injury, or loss of property.

We will not assume any liability for theft, vandalism, fire, or damage to a staff vehicle in our parking lot.
