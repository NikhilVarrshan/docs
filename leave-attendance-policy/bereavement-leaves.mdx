## 1. Philosophy

Loss of a loved one is deeply personal, often sudden, and emotionally disruptive. Zemuria recognizes that bereavement cannot be planned, scheduled, or treated as ordinary leave. This policy exists to ensure employees are given time, dignity, and space to grieve, attend rituals, and manage personal obligations during such periods.

Bereavement Leave is treated as a Special Emergency Leave and operates independently of standard leave categories.

## 2. Eligibility

- Applicable to full-time salaried employees and full-time contract staff
- Interns and apprentices may take time off for bereavement; however, such leave will be unpaid (Loss of Pay)

## 3. Leave Entitlement

- Employees are entitled to up to 5 working days of paid Bereavement Leave per incident
- Bereavement Leave is separate from PTO, Sick Leave, and Earned Leave
- Availing Bereavement Leave does not reduce any other leave balances

## 4. Eligible Relationships

### 4.1 Automatically Eligible (No Special Approval Required)

Bereavement Leave may be availed upon the passing of:

- Spouse (legally married)
- Parents, children, siblings
- Grandparents
- Parents-in-law
- Any dependent family member residing with the employee

### 4.2 Discretionary Eligibility (HR Approval Required)

Zemuria recognizes that family structures and relationships vary. Bereavement Leave may also be granted, subject to HR approval, for the passing of:

- Long-term domestic partners
- Unmarried partners or fiancés
- Non-blood, non-marital relationships of significant emotional dependency

Requests under this category will be reviewed compassionately and confidentially, without requiring intrusive justification.

## 5. Usage Flexibility

Bereavement Leave may be taken:

- Consecutively or non-consecutively
- Immediately or spread across a short period

Leave may be used for:

- Arranging or attending funerals or memorial services
- Performing last rites or religious obligations
- Traveling long distances
- Resolving inheritance, legal, or administrative matters
- Mourning and emotional recovery

## 6. Notice & Approval

- Bereavement Leave is treated as an emergency leave

## 7. Interaction with Other Leave Rules

The following rules do not apply to Bereavement Leave:

Additional clarifications:

- National and state-notified holidays remain holidays and are not counted as Bereavement Leave
- If additional time beyond 5 working days is required:
  - PTO, Earned Leave, or Loss of Pay may be used with HR approval

## 8. Documentation & Misuse

- Zemuria may request reasonable confirmation where required
- Any leave found to be falsely claimed may result in:
  - Reversal of the leave
  - Salary deduction
  - Disciplinary action, regardless of when the leave was taken

## 9. Compassion

Zemuria acknowledges that grief timelines vary across individuals and cultures. In exceptional circumstances, HR and leadership may approve:

- Extended unpaid leave
- Temporary flexible working arrangements

Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, with empathy and confidentiality.
