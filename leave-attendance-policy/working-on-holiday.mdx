## 1. Working Days & Weekend Bridging Rule

- Zemuria follows a 5‑day work week (Monday to Friday).
- Saturday and Sunday are weekly offs.

### 1.1 Sandwich / Bridging Leave Rule

To discourage misuse of weekends for extended breaks without adequate leave balance:

- If an employee applies leave on both Friday and the following Monday, the leave will be counted as 4 days:
  - Friday
  - Saturday
  - Sunday
  - Monday

#### Clarifications

- Leave only on Friday → counts as 1 day
- Leave only on Monday → counts as 1 day
- Leave on Friday + Monday → counts as 4 days

This rule applies across all leave types (PTO, Sick Leave, Earned Leave).

## 2. Leave Categories

Zemuria recognizes the following leave types:

1. Paid Time Off (PTO / Casual Leave)
2. Sick Leave (SL)
3. Earned Leave (EL) – applicable after completion of 1 year

## 3. Leave Entitlement – Freshers (0–12 months)

### 3.1 Annual Allocation

For employees in their first year of employment:

- PTO / Casual Leave: 12 days per year
- Sick Leave: 12 days per year

**Total:** 24 days per year

### 3.2 Monthly Accrual (Prorated)

- PTO: **1 day per month**
- Sick Leave: **1 day per month**

> Example:
>
> - January balance: 2 leaves (1 PTO + 1 SL)
> - February balance (unused Jan): 4 leaves

Unused leaves carry forward within the same year only.

### 3.3 Exceeding Accrued Leaves

- If an employee takes more leave than accrued for that month/year:
  - Excess days will be treated as **Loss of Pay (LOP)**

## 4. Leave Entitlement – Employees After 1 Year (Confirmed Employees)

Upon completing 12 months of continuous service, employees become eligible for Earned Leave.

### 4.1 Annual Allocation

- PTO / Casual Leave: 12 days per year
- Sick Leave: 12 days per year
- Earned Leave: 12 days per year

**Total:** 36 days per year

### 4.2 Monthly Accrual

- PTO: 1 day/month
- Sick Leave: 1 day/month
- Earned Leave: 1 day/month

Total monthly accrual: **3 days**

## 5. Planned Leave Rules

### 5.1 Short Planned Leave (1–2 continuous days)

- Must be applied at least 7 calendar days in advance
- Subject to manager approval

### 5.2 Medium Planned Leave (3–15 continuous days)

- Must be applied at least 30 days in advance
- Employee may combine PTO, Sick Leave, and Earned Leave
- Approval subject to project timelines and team capacity

### 5.3 Long Planned Leave (More than 15 continuous days)

Given Zemuria’s venture studio operating model and dependency on key personnel:

- Any planned leave exceeding 15 continuous calendar days requires:
  - Minimum 90 days (3 months) prior written notice
  - Detailed handover plan
  - Explicit managerial and leadership approval

Failure to provide sufficient notice may result in:

- Partial approval
- Rescheduling of leave
- Conversion of excess days to Loss of Pay (LOP) at management discretion

### 5.4 Sandwich Rule Applicability for Long Leaves

For extended leave periods:

- All intervening weekends (Saturday & Sunday) are counted as leave days
- Any Friday–Monday combination within the leave window will trigger the sandwich rule

> Example: Leave from Thursday to following Wednesday:
>
> - Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
> - All 7 days are counted as leave

## 6. Sick Leave & Emergency Leave Policy

### 6.1 Immediate Sick Leave

- Sick Leave can be availed on the same day without prior approval
- Applicable for genuine illness or medical emergencies

### 6.2 Multiple-Day Sick Leave (Documentation Requirements)

To balance employee trust with workplace health and safety, documentation requirements are tiered as follows:

- Up to 2 continuous working days:
  - No mandatory medical documentation required.
  - Employee may self-declare illness.
- More than 1 working day (i.e., 2nd day onward):
  - Employee must submit doctor’s prescription or medical diagnosis indicating the nature of illness.
- More than 2 continuous working days:
  - Mandatory submission of:
    1. Doctor’s prescription / diagnosis
    2. Medical Fitness Certificate clearly stating that the employee is _fit to return to work_

The fitness-to-return requirement is to ensure employee recovery and to prevent health risks to teammates.

There is no prior notice requirement for sick leave.

## 7. Holiday Treatment During Leave Periods

### 7.1 National & State-Notified Holidays

- National holidays (e.g., Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti) and state-notified public/festival holidays are statutory holidays.
- These holidays will NOT be counted as leave days, even if they fall within a continuous or long leave period.
- Such days are treated as paid holidays by default and do not reduce any leave balance.

### 7.2 Company-Declared Optional / Floating Holidays

Zemuria may declare certain **optional or floating holidays** (for example, religious or cultural observances applicable to specific groups).

Rules for optional/floating holidays:

- If an employee **opts to observe** an optional/floating holiday as a standalone day, it is treated as a **company holiday**.
- If an optional/floating holiday falls **within a continuous leave window** (planned or long leave):
  - It **WILL be counted as a leave day**, irrespective of the employee’s religion or personal affiliation.

This ensures consistency and prevents selective exclusion during extended absences.

### 7.3 Weekends

- All intervening **Saturdays and Sundays** falling within a continuous leave window are **counted as leave days**, as per the sandwich and long-leave rules.

## 8. Leave Accumulation & Carry Forward

### 8.1 PTO & Sick Leave

- Cannot be carried forward to the next calendar year
- Unused balance is settled as **cash payout** at year end

### 8.2 Earned Leave

- Earned Leave accrues at **1 day per month** after completion of 12 months of service
- Earned Leave may be carried forward subject to a **maximum balance of 24 days**
- Once the balance reaches **24 days**, no further Earned Leave will accrue until the balance reduces

> Earned Leave is designed for long‑term life events such as marriage, extended vacations, or personal sabbaticals.

## 9. Year‑End Leave Encashment

At the end of each calendar year:

- Unused PTO will be **encashed** based on the employee’s pay grade
- Unused Sick Leave will also be **encashed** as a wellness incentive
- Encashment will be paid along with **December payroll**

> PTO and Sick Leave **cannot be rolled over**, only encashed.

### **9.1 On Exit / Separation**

Upon resignation, termination, or separation:

- Earned Leave (EL):

  - Only EL is encashed on exit

  - Encashable EL is capped at a maximum of 24 days

  - Any Earned Leave beyond the cap shall lapse without encashment

 - PTO / Casual Leave: Not encashed on exit; unused balance lapses  

 - Sick Leave: Not encashed on exit; unused balance lapses  

 - Compensatory Off (if any): Not encashed on exit; unused balance lapses  

Encashment on exit shall be calculated on Basic Pay only, excluding allowances, bonuses, incentives, or variable pay, and shall be settled as part of the final full-and-final settlement.

## 10. Loss of Pay (LOP)

- Leave taken beyond available balance will be treated as **LOP**
- LOP directly impacts monthly salary

## 11. Governance & Final Authority

- All leave approvals are subject to manager discretion
- Zemuria reserves the right to revise this policy to align with:
  - Indian labour laws
  - Business requirements
  - Operational realities
