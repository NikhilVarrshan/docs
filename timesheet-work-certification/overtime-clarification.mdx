11 Time spent completing unfinished work to meet standard productivity expectations does not constitute overtime, provided total productive work does not exceed 48 hours per week.

Overtime compensation applies only where:

- productive work exceeds 48 hours in a workweek, and
- such excess work is expressly required or approved in accordance with law or contract.
