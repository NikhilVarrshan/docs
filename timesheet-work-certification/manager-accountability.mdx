title: "14.5 Manager Accountability (Critical)"
---

## **1. Due Diligence Requirement**

Managers approving timesheets are required to:

- review task descriptions,
- assess outputs and progress,
- correlate hours with deliverables (e.g., code commits, tickets, documentation).

Approval must never be automatic or symbolic.

**Misconduct by Managers**

Approving inaccurate, inflated, or misleading timesheets - whether knowingly or through negligence - constitutes misconduct.

Managers may be subject to:

- disciplinary action,
- loss of managerial authority,
- performance consequences,
- termination in severe or repeated cases.
