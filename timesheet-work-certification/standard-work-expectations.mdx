The standard workweek consists of 48 hours of productive work, typically spread across Monday to Friday.

This translates to approximately 9.5 hours of productive work per working day, excluding meal breaks.

**Daily Expectations**

Employees are expected to:

- plan their workday to meet daily productivity requirements,
- manage time efficiently,
- complete assigned tasks within standard working hours wherever reasonably possible.

Failure to meet daily expectations may require completion of work beyond standard hours, as outlined in Company policy, without constituting overtime unless the 48-hour threshold is exceeded.

**6. Timesheet Submission Requirements**

**6.1 Daily Recording**

Employees must record their work in the designated timesheet system daily.

Timesheets must reflect:

- tasks worked on,
- approximate productive hours spent,
- brief description of work performed.

6.2 Accuracy Obligation

Employees must ensure that:

- entries are truthful and accurate,
- hours claimed reasonably correspond to actual work performed,
- entries are not inflated, backfilled, or fabricated.
- Submitting inaccurate or misleading timesheets constitutes misconduct.
