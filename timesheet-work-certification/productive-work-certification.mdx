### 3 . The Company measures work based on productive contribution, not:

- time spent at a desk,
- system login duration,
- passive availability,
- attendance alone.

### **3.1 Productive work includes:**

- assigned tasks and deliverables,
- coding, testing, reviews, deployments,
- documentation and design work,
- meetings with clear business purpose,
- approved training directly related to role responsibilities.

Idle time, excessive breaks, personal activities, or unrelated work do not qualify as productive hours.
