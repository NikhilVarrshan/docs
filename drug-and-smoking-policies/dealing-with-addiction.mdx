title: "Dealing with Addiction"
---

Being sober is a prerequisite to thriving at our company, and we want to help you as much as possible. We offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) that can help you overcome addictions.

If you encounter a problem, please contact our HR/Office of the CEO. We wonâ€™t tolerate substance addiction that results in violent, offensive, or inappropriate behavior.

All forms of addiction that impact your ability to work and cannot be rectified at your own costs within the 30-day LOP period, even after our EAP, will directly impact your employment with Zemuria with termination for cause.
