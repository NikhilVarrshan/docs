title: "3.3 Dealing with Addiction"
description: "Dealing with Addiction and Support"
---

Zemuria acknowledges substance addiction as a health concern and encourages individuals to seek help before it impacts work or safety.

Employees may access support through Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) or other approved mechanisms.

Seeking help proactively will not result in punitive action, provided performance and conduct standards are maintained.

**However:**

- Substance abuse that results in violent, unsafe, offensive, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
- Continued impairment that cannot be rectified within a reasonable period will result in termination for cause.

### Disciplinary Action

Violations of this policy may result in:

- Immediate suspension
- Termination of employment or contract
- Removal from company premises
- Legal action, where applicable

Severity of action will depend on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation.

Sobriety, sound judgment, and personal responsibility are essential to thriving at Zemuria. We expect every individual to uphold these standards in the interest of personal well-being, team safety, and organizational integrity.
