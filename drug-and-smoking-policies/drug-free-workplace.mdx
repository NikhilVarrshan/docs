Zemuria is a drug-free workplace. Whether you are an employee, contractor, or visitor, you must not bring, use, give away, or sell any drugs on company premises.

If you are caught with illegal drugs or show that you are under the influence of substances or show substances or possession of such substances in any random drug test inside the premises, you will face disciplinary action up to and including termination.

We will conduct drug tests at the management/HR discretion at any point in your employment for all employees or any employee or group of employees at any time inside our office or any of our properties. For these purposes, consent is a part of your employment contract, and a non-consent (without permission/proper medical justification, which has already been disclosed) will automatically terminate your employment.

- All types of illegal drugs that are not allowed by the local government.
