### **1. Prescription Drugs and Medical Treatment**

Zemuria recognizes that employees and contractors may be prescribed medication for legitimate medical reasons.

If a prescription medication may impair judgment, coordination, alertness, or performance, the individual must proactively inform HR and immediate Manager.

Individuals may be required to submit documentation to confirm lawful prescription use.

The company may request a medical assessment to determine whether the medication impacts the individual’s ability to work safely and effectively.

### **Temporary Impact**

If the impact is temporary and reversible, the company may, at its discretion, provide a temporary leave or loss-of-pay (LOP) period.

This does not affect employment status but must comply with company leave policies.

### **Permanent Impact**

If a medication or medical condition results in a non-reversible impairment that prevents effective performance of job responsibilities, employment may be terminated in a fair and respectful manner, subject to applicable laws.
