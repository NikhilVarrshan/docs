title: "Prescription Drugs"

If you feel that a prescription drug (e.g., an anxiety medication, etc.,) unexpectedly affects your senses, thinking, or movement, ask for the rest of your day off. If your HR/Manager suspects substance abuse, you may face disciplinary action.

If you are under regular prescription or use for any medical treatment, please disclose full details, your prescription, and the time length of your prescription to the HR. The company, in its commitment to your well-being, will direct a medical team to assess if this will impact your ability to work.

If it's found to do so with an impact that can be reversed after a time-off, the Company may, at management's discretion, provide you with a temporary 'Loss of Pay' break over the mandated 30-day time period that you can take, which will not affect your employment status. You cannot use your sick leave for this reason.

If it's found to have a non-reversible impact that will affect your employment or performance with the Company, your employment will be terminated without cause, in accordance with our commitment to fairness, and you can collect your severance checks as eligible for your employment along with a glowing experience letter and a good referral for your next employment.

If no impact is found, your employment is not affected, and you'll have a no-objection certification or written permission from the HR/Management to show during Drug tests or when asked.
