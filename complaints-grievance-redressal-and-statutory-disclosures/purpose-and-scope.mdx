title: "11.1 Purpose And Scope"
---

**1. Purpose**

The Company is committed to maintaining a workplace that is fair, professional, respectful, and compliant with applicable law. This policy provides a structured mechanism for raising and resolving workplace complaints and grievances, and sets out key statutory disclosures and compliance principles relevant to employment.

This policy is intended to:

- enable employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation,
- ensure concerns are handled promptly, confidentially, and fairly,
- ensure consistent handling of complaints across teams and levels,
- clarify the scope of matters handled under this policy versus other policies (e.g., POSH).

**2. Scope and Applicability**

**2.1 Covered Persons**

This policy applies to:

- all full-time employees of the Company.

**2.2 Non-Full-Time Staff (Interns/Contractors/Consultants)**

Interns, contractors, consultants, and other non-full-time personnel are generally governed by their respective agreements and project terms. However:

- they may raise concerns related to workplace safety, unlawful conduct, harassment, or confidentiality breaches,
- the Company may, at its discretion, review and address such concerns through an appropriate process.

**2.3 Exclusions**

This policy does not replace:

- the Company’s POSH Policy (sexual harassment complaints and POSH procedures),
- disciplinary processes initiated independently by HR based on policy violations.

Where a complaint overlaps multiple areas, HR will determine the correct process and may run coordinated processes where necessary.
