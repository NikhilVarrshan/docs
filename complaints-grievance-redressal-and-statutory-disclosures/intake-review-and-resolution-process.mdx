### **Step 1 - Acknowledgement**

HR will acknowledge receipt of the complaint within a reasonable timeframe.

### **Step 2 - Triage and Classification**

HR will classify the complaint as:

- grievance,
- misconduct allegation,
- compliance concern,
- POSH (redirect),
- safety issue,
- or mixed category.

HR may take immediate interim steps if there is a risk of harm, retaliation, or evidence destruction.

### **Step 3 - Preliminary Review**

HR may conduct a preliminary review to determine:

- whether sufficient information exists,
- whether immediate action is required,
- whether a formal inquiry is warranted.

### **Step 4 - Inquiry (if required)**

Where needed, HR may:

- interview parties and witnesses,
- review documentation and digital evidence,
- coordinate with IT/security for logs (where relevant),
- seek written statements.

The inquiry process will be handled with confidentiality and professionalism.

### **Step 5 - Outcome and Corrective Action**

Potential outcomes include:

- no action (not substantiated),
- counselling or mediation (where appropriate),
- written warnings or disciplinary action,
- workflow/reporting adjustments,
- training or process changes,
- access restrictions or security changes,
- termination (in serious cases), subject to Company procedure and law.

HR will communicate the decision to relevant parties to the extent appropriate, maintaining confidentiality.
