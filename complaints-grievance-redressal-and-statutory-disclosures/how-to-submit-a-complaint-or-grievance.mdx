To help review the matter efficiently, include:

- a description of the incident(s),
- dates/times (as best as possible),
- names of involved persons,
- any evidence (messages, emails, screenshots, documents),
- names of witnesses (if any),
- the impact on work or workplace environment,
- desired resolution (if any).
