title: "11.8 Confidentiality And Non Retaliation"
---

All participants must maintain confidentiality:

- complainants,
- respondents,
- witnesses,
- managers and leaders involved.

Breach of confidentiality that harms the process or retaliates against any party may result in disciplinary action.

**11. Non-Retaliation (Strict)**

Retaliation is strictly prohibited. Any employee who believes they are facing retaliation should report it immediately to HR.

Retaliation is treated as serious misconduct and may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
