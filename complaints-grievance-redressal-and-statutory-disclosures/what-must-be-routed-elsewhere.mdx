**Sexual Harassment (POSH)**

Any complaint involving sexual harassment must be raised and handled under the POSH Policy through the Internal Committee (IC). If a complaint is incorrectly filed under this policy, HR will redirect it to the POSH process.

**6.2 Pure Performance Management (Non-Misconduct)**

Concerns that are purely about role expectations or performance planning may be handled through performance management processes. However:

if the employee alleges unfairness, bias, or retaliation, HR may treat it as a grievance.
