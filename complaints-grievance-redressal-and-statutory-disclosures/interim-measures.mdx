title: "11.7 Interim Measures"
---

To protect individuals and ensure fairness during review, HR may implement interim measures such as:

- separation of reporting relationships,
- changes to work allocation,
- temporary access restrictions,
- temporary relocation of seating/work location,
- instructions to avoid contact, where appropriate.

Interim measures are not disciplinary findings and do not imply guilt.
