title: "Escalation And Appeal"
---

If an employee believes:

- the complaint was not handled fairly,
- or there is a material procedural lapse,

they may request a review by HR through the designated escalation channel.

HR may, at its discretion, appoint an alternate reviewer or panel for sensitive matters.
