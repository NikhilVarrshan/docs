title: "Referrals"

If you know someone you think would be a good fit for a position at our company, please refer them to our organization by informing our HR/Manager/Office of the CEO.

All external referrals of power (from your local MLA, MP, elected representatives, people who govern or are in public office, etc.) are immediately rejected and discarded. If the referred person carries the referral in person for any recruitment drive (online/IRL), that person/candidate will be blacklisted from all future employment with Zemuria and its affiliated companies for life.

## Eligibility and Instructions 

All Zemuria employees can refer people. You can refer when you know there are open positions or if you feel a specific talent fits right into Zemuria.

When their referral gets hired, team members will be granted a one-time monetary bonus, extra points during a performance review, or equivalent. Monetary bonuses will be paid along with their next month's payroll. However, they'll lose their referral bonus, which will be deducted from their future pay if their referral leaves the Company voluntarily or is terminated for cause within two years.

- All referrals must be public and posted in #internal-chat. Submit a referral with the Candidate's Name, a one-liner describing them, a portfolio link/git link, and their resum√©.
- Team members have the right to veto your referral with a justification by starting a thread in discord in your referral post, and you can challenge them to convince the veto if you do not think the reason is justified. **You can supersede all vetoes** and stick to your referral as the person who refers. If you choose not to supersede, your referral will be rejected with even one veto from any team member with a valid justification.
- All finalized referrals are moved to HR for interviews. However, if your referral performs poorly in the interviews (Note: your referral getting rejected is not treated as performing poorly), this will be recorded in your performance review. This is a core part of your culture where you show your decision-making skills and the ability to find good people for the team.
- Any candidate who has applied/rejected in the last three months is disqualified. All ex-employees and blacklisted candidates/employees are disqualified. The HR/Manager/Office of the CEO will inform as and when any disqualifying referral is made.
- Rewards will be split equally for multiple referrals of the same candidate.
