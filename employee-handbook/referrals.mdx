title: "1.7 Referral Policy"
description: "Referrals"
---

Zemuria encourages referrals that help identify high-quality talent aligned with the company’s standards and culture.

All employees may submit referrals for open roles through the designated internal channels, along with relevant supporting information such as a brief profile, portfolio, or résumé.

Referrals are evaluated using the same criteria as all other candidates. A referral does not guarantee an interview, selection, or employment.

Referral incentives, where applicable, are governed by separate internal guidelines and may be subject to conditions such as tenure, performance, or retention of the referred candidate.

Zemuria does not accept referrals that attempt to exert external influence, pressure, or preferential treatment. Any referral linked to political office, public authority, or improper influence may be rejected outright.

The company reserves the right to reject, defer, or disqualify referrals at its discretion.
