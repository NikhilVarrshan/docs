Zemuria is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to providing a workplace free from discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment based on protected characteristics, including but not limited to gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, or veteran status.

This policy applies to all individuals engaged with Zemuria, including full-time employees, contractors, interns, trainees, apprentices, executives, and members of HR.

### **Our Commitment**

In practice, this means that we:

- Make hiring, promotion, compensation, and assignment decisions based on skills, experience, performance, and potential.
- Strive to reduce bias in recruitment and evaluation processes, including through structured interviews and objective assessment criteria.
- Provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities to enable safe access to our premises, tools, and work systems, where applicable.
- Use inclusive and respectful language across official communications, documentation, and job postings.
- Promote awareness through appropriate training on professional conduct, sensitivity, and communication.

### **Conduct and Accountability**

Discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate behavior is not tolerated. Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of engagement, in accordance with applicable workplace conduct and disciplinary policies.

### **Reporting and Non-Retaliation**

Any individual who experiences or witnesses discrimination is encouraged to report the concern through the designated internal reporting channels, including HR, the Internal Complaints Committee (where applicable), or other authorized management representatives.

Zemuria strictly prohibits retaliation against any individual who raises a concern or participates in an investigation in good faith. Retaliation itself constitutes a serious policy violation and will result in disciplinary action
