Zemuria is an equal opportunity employer. We donâ€™t tolerate discrimination against protected characteristics (gender, age, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, or veteran status.) We want all staff (including apprentices, trainees, interns, executives, and HR) to treat everyone respectfully and professionally. In practice, this means that we:

- Hire and promote people based on skills, experience, or potential and try to reduce bias in every process (e.g., through structured interviews.)
- Make accommodations to help people with disabilities move about safely on our premises and use our products, services, and equipment
- Use inclusive language in all official documents, signs, and job ads.
- Conduct sensitivity and communication training.

Apart from those actions, we commit to penalizing every discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate behavior.

To do this properly, please report any discriminatory action against yourself or your colleagues to Office of the CEO. Our company will not retaliate against you if you file a complaint or discrimination lawsuit. Any staff member who retaliates or discriminates will face disciplinary action.
