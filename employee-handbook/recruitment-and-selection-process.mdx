Our hiring steps might vary across roles, but we always aim for a fair and effective process in hiring great people. If you are hiring for an open role, you will likely go through these steps:

- Identify the need for a new job opening.
- Decide whether to hire externally or internally from our apprentices or interns if they're not assigned to any teams.
- Review job descriptions
- Decide on hiring stages and possible timeframes.
- Review resumes
- Shortlist applicants.
- Screen and interview candidates.
- Run background checks and check references.
- Select the most suitable candidate.
- Make an official offer.

Throughout this process, we aim to keep candidates informed, communicate well with each other, and give everyone an equal opportunity to work with us. Ask our recruiters for help whenever you need to enhance your candidate experience or write an inclusive job description.
