Zemuria hires selectively and intentionally to meet clearly identified business and operational needs.

Hiring decisions are initiated when a team, manager, or venture identifies a sustained requirement for additional capacity or expertise. Such requests are reviewed by leadership and HR to assess scope, timing, budget, and role definition before any hiring activity begins.

All hiring decisions are made by designated hiring managers and leadership, in accordance with company priorities and compliance requirements. Employees may provide input, recommendations, or referrals, but hiring authority remains centralized to ensure consistency, quality, and accountability.

Zemuria may hire for full-time employment, contractual roles, or time-bound engagements depending on the nature of the work, jurisdictional requirements, and business needs.

The company reserves the right to modify, pause, or cancel hiring at any stage.
