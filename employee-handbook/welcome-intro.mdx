## **Welcome to Zemuria**

Thank you for joining Zemuria. We are excited to see what you will achieve with us. This handbook defines who we are and how we work together. It outlines our expectations, commitments, and responsibilities, and serves as a guide to help you understand how we operate as an organization.

This handbook is not a contract or a guarantee of employment. It is a living document and may be updated from time to time at the company’s discretion. It applies to all staff, including executives, employees, contractors, interns, trainees, apprentices, and volunteers, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Our company year runs from January to December of the same calendar year. Our financial year runs from April of the current year to March of the following year.

For all purposes, “Zemuria” refers to Zemuria Inc., USA, and Mercemur Technologies Private Limited, India.

### **Your First Week**

You will begin working on meaningful, real work from Day 01.

As Zemuria operates with small, focused teams, your manager is directly responsible for your onboarding. Your manager will set expectations, review your responsibilities, and help you understand how your role fits into the broader organization. If you have questions, your first point of contact should always be your manager.

During your first few days, you will spend time getting to know:

- Your manager
- Your immediate team
- The CEO

We operate with a lean, low-friction hierarchy. You will often see the CEO working alongside teams - asking questions, contributing to discussions, and participating in problem-solving sessions. This level of engagement is intentional and reflects how we work. All professional conduct, reporting lines, and performance evaluation processes continue to apply regardless of role or title.

If this style of working feels overwhelming or uncomfortable, Zemuria may not be the right environment for you.

If your role is not designated as BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), the company will provide a device appropriate to your role. Depending on requirements, you may also be provided or approved for peripherals such as a display, keyboard, or mouse, subject to HR and Operations approval.

Before signing your employment terms, you will be asked to review this handbook and the Culture Handbook.

As you gain confidence and demonstrate ownership, you may be entrusted with additional responsibilities aligned with your growth and performance.

### **Call Signs**

Every full-time employee at Zemuria is assigned a unique call sign, which also serves as their official company email identity.

**Purpose**

Call signs were introduced to:

- Reduce external spam and unsolicited contact
- Protect employee privacy
- Enable internal-first identity and communication
- Call signs are used internally and externally for company communication and email correspondence.

**Structure**

Call signs follow a department-based prefix combined with a sequential identifier:

- DEV Alpha, DEV Beta, DEV Gamma (Development)
- DES Alpha, DES Beta, DES Gamma (Design)

Similar patterns apply to other departments such as Marketing, Operations, etc.

The call sign reflects when and where an employee joined, not their current department.

**Assignment & Permanence**

Call signs are assigned at the time of joining.

Call signs cannot be changed, even if an employee later transfers to another department.

The call sign remains with the employee for the duration of their employment.

Call signs are reassigned to another individual only after the original holder exits and the call sign pool is exhausted.

### **Eligibility**

Call signs are issued only to full-time employees.

Contractors, interns, and temporary staff do not receive call signs and will use alternative company-approved email formats.

Call signs do not replace legal names in official employment records and are used solely as an identity and communication mechanism within Zemuria’s systems.
