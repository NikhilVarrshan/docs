description: "Employment Policies, Contracts, and Engagement Types"

### **1. Purpose and Scope**

This document defines the different types of working relationships at Zemuria and outlines the general expectations, rights, and limitations associated with each engagement type.

Specific benefits, leave entitlements, incentives, protections, and obligations are governed by their respective policies and agreements and may vary by role, jurisdiction, and engagement classification.

Nothing in this document should be interpreted as creating an employment relationship where one does not exist.

### **2. Contract and Employment Types**

Zemuria engages individuals under multiple working arrangements based on role requirements, business needs, and jurisdictional compliance.

**2.1 Full-Time Employees (FTEs)**

Full-time employees are individuals engaged directly by Zemuria as salaried employees under applicable local employment laws.

- **Working Expectations**

Standard working expectation is up to 48 hours per week, subject to role requirements, jurisdictional limits, and operational needs.

- **Eligibility and Benefits**

Full-time employees may be eligible for employee-specific benefits, including but not limited to:

statutory and company-defined leave benefits,

performance appraisal and performance-linked incentives,

maternal, parental, and emergency leave policies,

employee-only programs, benefits, and internal initiatives,

as defined in the applicable policy documents and employment agreement.

- **Governance**

Employment terms are governed by a formal employment agreement.

Applicable labor and employment laws apply.

Continued employment is subject to performance, conduct, and business requirements.

**2.2 Full-Time Contractors**

Full-time contractors are individuals engaged on a contractual basis to work with Zemuria on a sustained, full-time commitment, without being classified as employees.

- **Working Expectations**

Typical engagement expectation is up to 48 hours per week, or an equivalent monthly commitment, as defined in the service agreement.

- **Status and Limitations**

Full-time contractors are not employees of Zemuria.

Contractors are not eligible for employee-specific benefits, perks, statutory entitlements, or internal employee programs unless explicitly stated in their contract.

- **Governance**

Contractors are governed strictly by the terms of their service agreement.

Applicable commercial and contract laws apply.

Contractors are responsible for their own statutory, tax, and social security obligations unless otherwise specified.

**2.3 Part-Time Contractors**

Part-time contractors are individuals engaged for limited hours, specific deliverables, or defined scopes of work.

- **Working Expectations**

Engagement is less than full-time hours and is defined explicitly in the contract or statement of work.

- **Status and Limitations**

Part-time contractors are not employees of Zemuria.

They are not eligible for employee benefits, leave policies, incentives, or employee-only programs unless explicitly stated in writing.

- **Governance**

Engagement is governed solely by contractual terms and applicable commercial laws.

**2.4 Interns, Trainees, and Apprentices**

Interns, trainees, and apprentices at Zemuria are engaged under contractor-style arrangements, unless explicitly classified otherwise by law or agreement.

- **Classification**

Interns, trainees, and apprentices are treated as contractors, not employees.

Their engagement is typically for learning, training, or fixed-term developmental purposes.

- **Benefits and Limitations**

They are not eligible for employee-specific benefits, leave entitlements, incentives, or employee-only programs unless explicitly stated in their engagement agreement.

Any stipend, honorarium, or compensation is defined solely by contract.

- **Governance**

Engagement terms, duration, scope, and expectations are governed by a written agreement.

Applicable commercial, training, or apprenticeship regulations may apply based on jurisdiction.

**3. Benefits and Policy Applicability**

Benefits, leave entitlements, incentives, protections, and internal programs differ materially between full-time employees and contractors.

Contractors (including interns, trainees, and apprentices) are not covered under employee leave, appraisal, incentive, or benefit policies unless explicitly stated.

Each policy within the handbook clearly specifies its scope of applicability:

employees only,

contractors only,

or both.

**4. Jurisdictional Compliance**

Depending on country-specific legal requirements, Zemuria may engage individuals as employees or contractors for compliance reasons.

- **Such classification:**

does not imply equivalence of benefits, protections, or entitlements across engagement types,

does not override contractual terms,

and does not create an implied employment relationship.

**5. Supremacy of Agreements**

In the event of any inconsistency between this document and an individual’s employment agreement or service contract, the signed agreement shall prevail, subject to applicable law.
