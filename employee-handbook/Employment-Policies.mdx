## Contract Service Types

- On average, full-time contractors work at least 40 hours per week or 200 hours per month. 
- Part-time contractors are those who work fewer than 30 hours per week.
- Full-time contractors are entitled to our company’s complete benefits package

Depending on country-specific rules, we even have full-time employment roles that are not contract-based but salaried employees of Zemuria. However, complete benefit packages do not differ between Full-time contractors and Salaried employees; they just differ for compliance purposes.
