title: "1.6 Background Verification Policy"
---

Zemuria conducts mandatory background verification for all hires, including employees, contractors, interns, trainees, and apprentices, prior to or shortly after commencement of engagement.

Background checks are carried out to the extent permitted by applicable laws and may include, but are not limited to:

- identity verification
- employment history verification
- education verification
- criminal record checks (where legally permitted)
- role-specific or compliance-driven checks

Background verification is a condition of engagement. Employment or contractual engagement is not considered final until background checks are completed and cleared.

Any material misrepresentation, omission, or adverse finding may result in:

- withdrawal of offer,
- termination of employment or contract, or
- immediate disengagement, even after onboarding.

All background verification results are treated as confidential and used solely for employment and compliance purposes. Individuals may be given an opportunity to clarify or dispute findings where legally required.

All background check policies are applied consistently without discrimination, ensuring fairness and equal treatment for all employees.
