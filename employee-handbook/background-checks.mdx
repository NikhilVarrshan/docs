If you want to run background checks on candidates, ask Office of the CEO for guidance. This process is sensitive, and we must always abide by laws and ensure candidates understand our intentions. As a general rule, commission a background check for finalists only.

Depending on the roles, we commission specific checks to ensure the right fit for our team.

- Criminal record checks
- Employment history verification
- Education verification
- Professional license verification
- Credit checks (if applicable)
- Drug screening (if applicable)

Your employment is not guaranteed until the background checks come clean. If there are discrepancies in the results, post a full investigation we will terminate your employment, even after your onboarding is complete anytime during your employment.

All results are kept confidential and used only for employment purposes. We've included your right to dispute inaccurate information by cross-verifying found results and allowing you to file an explanation. If it's found satisfactory, we'll green-light your background checks.

Certain positions with confidential information will require additional screening, which will be announced as and when such will be conducted.

All background check policies are applied consistently without discrimination, ensuring fairness and equal treatment for all employees.
