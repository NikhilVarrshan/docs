Thank you for joining Zemuria. We are excited to see what you will achieve with us. This handbook defines who we are and how we work together. We are deeply committed to creating a fair and productive workplace, and we believe that with your help, we can achieve this. We’ve created this handbook to guide you and ensure that you feel secure and valued in our company. 

This handbook is not a contract or a guarantee of recruiting you. It’s a collection of our expectations, commitments, and responsibilities. Please read this staff handbook carefully and consult it whenever you need to. By staff, we mean executive, HR, employee, contractor, intern, trainee, apprentices, and/or volunteer.

Our company year is between January and December of the same year, whereas the financial year is between April of the current year and March of the following year.

Zemuria, for all purposes, refers to Zemuria Inc., U.S.A., and Mercemur Technologies Private Limited, India.

## Your First Week 

As soon as you come in, you'll have a friend assigned to help you get used to everything and introduce you to everyone. The assigned friend will help point you in the right direction when you have a question and don't know where to turn. We are here to support you during your first week and beyond, ensuring you feel welcomed and comfortable in our company.

Here are the most important people you'll meet, and spend time getting to know each other in your first few days.

- Your manager. Your manager will help you set your onboarding expectations immediately and will review your schedule for the next few weeks.
- Your immediate team.
- The CEO.

We follow a very flat hierarchy, and you'll see the CEO working amongst everyone, asking questions, contributing to work, and participating in brainstorming and problem-solving sessions. If you feel this is too intense for you, we are probably not your best people.

If your role is not a BYOD (bring your own device) role, we'll get you a device according to your role specifications and assist in getting you a display, external keyboard, mouse, etc. Depending on your role, you can also request them, and the HR and Ops team will decide.

Before signing your employment terms, you will be asked to review this handbook and our [<u>Culture handbook</u>](https://library.zemuria.com/3/culture).

You'll begin working on real work on Day 01. As you gain confidence and strengthen bonds with the team, we'll see if you can shoulder more responsibilities to grow into your role as you progress.

### Call signs 

You'll be given a unique 'Call sign' that represents you and your username/email within the company. All call signs are fixed and pre-decided. They are replaced and given to another person only when their availability is exhausted. A few special roles do not have any call signs but the person's role name or first name.

You'll be guided through setting up your email and digital workplace drives, given an Identity Card with a tag and an electronic pass, advised on necessary safety and security practices, and invited to the company Discord server, where you can introduce yourself to our global team.
