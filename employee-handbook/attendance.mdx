We expect you to be present during your scheduled working hours. If an emergency prevents you from coming to work one day, contact your HR/Manager/Office of the CEO as soon as possible. We will excuse unreported absences in severe accidents and acute medical emergencies. But whenever possible, we should know when you wonâ€™t be coming in.

Feel free to use the #leave-request channel in your Discord workspace to let HR/Office of the CEO record your absence and let your teammates know if you won't be coming in.

All attendance is only marked if you punch in/swipe electronically when you enter the office premises.
