title: "Quorum Structure by Function"
---

Quorum is defined per team or sub-team, not at a company-wide level.

**6. Engineering Function (All Sub-Teams)**

Engineering teams are divided into the following operational sub-units:

	•	App Engineering (Mobile / Desktop)

	•	AI / ML Engineering

	•	Backend Engineering

	•	Frontend Web Engineering

	•	Platform / Infrastructure (if applicable)

Each sub-team is evaluated independently for quorum.\
\
**6.1 App Engineering Teams (Mobile / Desktop)**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 60% of the sub-team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one engineer capable of build/release

	•	At least one engineer capable of bug triage or hotfix

**6.2 AI / ML Engineering Teams**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 60% of the sub-team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one model owner or system maintainer

	•	At least one engineer capable of deployment / inference monitoring

**6.3 Backend Engineering Teams**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 60% of the sub-team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one engineer familiar with core services

	•	At least one engineer authorized for production access or on-call escalation

**6.4 Frontend Web Engineering Teams**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 50% of the sub-team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one senior or decision-making frontend engineer

	•	At least one engineer capable of production UI fixes

**7. Design Function (UI / UX / Motion / Brand)**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 50% of the design team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one senior or lead designer available for approvals and handoffs

Design work is subject to quorum on high-impact days due to dependency with engineering and delivery timelines.

**8. Product, Studio Operations & Program Management**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 70% of the team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one owner per active project

	•	At least one delivery or coordination lead available\
\
**9. Marketing, Growth & Content Teams**

Minimum quorum

	•	≥ 50–60% of the team present

Mandatory role coverage

	•	At least one campaign owner or channel owner available

**10. Leadership, Finance & Administrative Roles**

Minimum quorum

	•	At least one accountable decision-maker available

Availability may be remote unless otherwise required.

**11. Leave Approval Mechanics**

	1.	Identification

	•	If a leave request falls on a high-impact operational day, this policy applies.

	2.	Quorum Check

	•	Managers verify whether approving the leave would breach quorum thresholds.

	3.	Role Coverage Check

	•	Managers ensure critical roles remain covered.

	4.	Approval Logic

	•	Leave approvals are generally processed on a first-come basis, subject to quorum.

	•	No team may fall below its defined quorum.

	5.	Transparency

	•	Decisions are documented without attributing intent or misconduct.

**12. Exclusions & Exceptions**

This policy does not override:

	•	Statutory or legally protected leave

	•	Medical or emergency leave, subject to documentation

	•	Pre-approved long leave applied well in advance, where coverage is planned

Exceptions, where granted, must be recorded.\
\
**13. Policy Intent Clarification**

This policy:

	•	Does not prohibit extending weekends or holidays

	•	Does not classify adjacency to holidays as misconduct

	•	Exists solely to ensure minimum operational continuity

Leave is an entitlement.

Simultaneous absence that disrupts operations is not.\
\
**14. Review & Amendments**

This policy may be reviewed periodically based on:

	•	Team size changes

	•	Operational complexity

	•	Delivery commitments
