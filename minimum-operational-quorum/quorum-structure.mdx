## 1. Quorum is defined per team or sub-team, not at a company-wide level.

**A. Engineering Function (All Sub-Teams)**

Engineering teams are divided into the following operational sub-units:

•	App Engineering (Mobile / Desktop)

•	AI / ML Engineering

•	Backend Engineering

•	Frontend Web Engineering

•	Platform / Infrastructure (if applicable)

Each sub-team is evaluated independently for quorum.\
\
**B.** **App Engineering Teams (Mobile / Desktop)**

1. Minimum quorum

   •	≥ 60% of the sub-team present
2. Mandatory role coverage

   •	At least one engineer capable of build/release

   •	At least one engineer capable of bug triage or hotfix

2. Mandatory role coverage

   •	At least one model owner or system maintainer

   •	At least one engineer capable of deployment / inference monitoring

**D. Backend Engineering Teams**

2. Mandatory role coverage

   •	At least one senior or lead designer available for approvals and handoffs

Design work is subject to quorum on high-impact days due to dependency with engineering and delivery timelines.

**G. Product, Studio Operations & Program Management**

**I. Leadership, Finance & Administrative Roles**

## **2. Leave Approval Mechanics**

**1. Identification**

   •	If a leave request falls on a high-impact operational day, this policy applies.

**2. Quorum Check**

   •	Managers verify whether approving the leave would breach quorum thresholds.

**3. Role Coverage Check**

   •	Managers ensure critical roles remain covered.

**4. Approval Logic**

   •	Leave approvals are generally processed on a first-come basis, subject to quorum.

   •	No team may fall below its defined quorum.

**5. Transparency**

   •	Decisions are documented without attributing intent or misconduct.

### **Exclusions & Exceptions**

This policy does not override:

•	Statutory or legally protected leave

•	Medical or emergency leave, subject to documentation

•	Pre-approved long leave applied well in advance, where coverage is planned

Exceptions, where granted, must be recorded.\
\
**Policy Intent Clarification**

This policy:

•	Does not prohibit extending weekends or holidays

•	Does not classify adjacency to holidays as misconduct

•	Exists solely to ensure minimum operational continuity

Leave is an entitlement. Simultaneous absence that disrupts operations is not permitted in Zemuria. \
\
**Review & Amendments**

This policy may be reviewed periodically based on:

•	Team size changes

•	Operational complexity

•	Delivery commitments
