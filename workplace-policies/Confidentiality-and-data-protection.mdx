title: "Confidentiality and data protection"
---

Zemuria operates across ventures, products, clients, and jurisdictions. Protecting confidential information, intellectual property, and personal data is fundamental to our business.

All staff are entrusted with sensitive information and are expected to handle it with care, judgment, and integrity at all times - during and after their association with Zemuria.

## **What Constitutes Confidential Information**

Confidential information includes, but is not limited to:

- Employee, contractor, and personnel records
- Unpublished financial data, forecasts, pricing, and investor materials
- Customer, partner, vendor, and prospect data
- Product roadmaps, technical designs, source code, models, prompts, datasets, and internal documentation
- Internal communications, strategy documents, and non-public initiatives
- Any information marked or reasonably understood to be confidential

This obligation applies regardless of the format - digital, physical, verbal, or visual.

**Access and Safeguards (Company Responsibility)**

Zemuria commits to reasonable and proportionate safeguards, including:

- Role-based access to systems and data
- Monitoring and auditing of access to sensitive information
- Secure infrastructure, encryption, backups, and access controls
- Privacy and security training as required
- Compliance with applicable data protection laws

**Your Responsibilities**

All staff must:

- Access confidential information only when required for authorized work
- Use company-approved systems and secure networks where mandated
- Protect credentials and never share passwords, tokens, or access keys
- Lock, encrypt, or otherwise secure devices and documents containing confidential data
- Dispose of confidential materials securely when no longer required
- Immediately report suspected data loss, breaches, or unauthorized access
- Unauthorized possession or retention of confidential information may result in immediate disciplinary action.

**BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and Remote Work**

Zemuria supports BYOD and remote work where approved. However, BYOD does not reduce confidentiality obligations.

If you use personal devices for Zemuria work, you agree to:

- Secure your device with passwords, biometrics, and encryption
- Keep operating systems and security updates current
- Avoid storing confidential data on unsecured or shared devices
- Allow company-directed security actions (such as access revocation or data wipe) in case of loss, theft, or exit
- Ensure no unauthorized person accesses company information through your device

Zemuria reserves the right to restrict or revoke BYOD access if security standards are not met.

**Prohibited Conduct**

You must not:

- Use confidential information for personal benefit or outside work
- Disclose confidential information to unauthorized parties
- Copy, export, or replicate confidential materials without approval
- Store company data on insecure platforms or devices
- Retain company data after termination of engagement

Any intentional misuse will result in immediate termination and may lead to legal action.
