## **Confidentiality and data protection **

We want to protect private information about clients, staff, partners, and our company. Examples of confidential information are:

- Contractor and Staff records
- Unpublished, Non-Public financial information
- Data of customers/partners/vendors
- Customer lists (existing and prospective)
- Unpublished, Non-Public goals, forecasts, and initiatives marked as confidential

As part of our hiring process, we may ask you to sign non-compete and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs.) We are also committed to

- Restrict and monitor access to sensitive data.
- Develop transparent data collection procedures.
- Train staff in online privacy and security measures.
- Build secure networks to protect online data from cyberattacks.
- Establish data protection practices (e.g., secure locks, data encryption, frequent backups, access authorization.)

We also expect you to act responsibly when handling confidential information.

### **You must: **

- Lock or secure confidential information at all times.
- Shred confidential documents when they are no longer needed.
- Make sure you view confidential information only on secure devices.
- Only disclose information to other staff when it’s necessary and authorized.
- Keep confidential documents inside our company’s premises unless it’s necessary to move them.
- Unauthorized possession of confidential documents will result in confiscation of all such documents and may lead to immediate termination of employment unless proper authorization is obtained from relevant personnel.

### **You must not: **

- Use confidential information for your benefit or profit.
- Disclose confidential information to anyone outside of our company.
- Replicate confidential documents and files and store them on insecure devices.

This policy is crucial for our company’s legality and reputation. We will terminate any staff who breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit.

We may also discipline any unintentional breach of this policy, depending on its frequency and seriousness. We will terminate anyone who repeatedly disregards this policy, even when they do so unintentionally.
