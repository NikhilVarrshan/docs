These policies exist to protect individuals and the organization. Violations will be addressed proportionately based on severity, intent, and recurrence.

Repeated negligence, even if unintentional, may result in disciplinary action.

Zemuria’s foundation is mutual respect, trust, and responsibility. We expect everyone working with us to uphold these principles consistently.
