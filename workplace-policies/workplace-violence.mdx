title: "Workplace Violence"
---

Violence in our workplace is a severe form of harassment. It includes physical and sexual assault, destruction of property, threats to harm a person or property, and verbal and psychological abuse. We want to avoid those incidents altogether, but we also want to be ready to respond if needed.

For this reason, we ask you to

- Report to the HR/Manager/Office of the CEO if you suspect or know that someone is being violent. Your report will be confidential, and we will investigate the situation at your discretion.
- Call our buildingâ€™s security if you witness incidents of severe physical violence, and for your safety, avoid getting involved.

We will treat staff who verbally threaten others as high risk, and they will receive an appropriate penalty. If the Management finds that an employee commits an act of violence, we will terminate that individual and possibly press criminal charges. Staff who damage property deliberately will be solely responsible for paying for it.
