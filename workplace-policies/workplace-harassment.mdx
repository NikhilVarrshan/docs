Harassment is a broad term and may include seemingly harmless actions, like gossip. We can’t create an exhaustive list, but here are some instances that we consider harassment:

- Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose
- Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature
- Commenting derogatorily on a person’s ethnic heritage or religious beliefs
- Starting or spreading rumors about a person’s personal life
- Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out to perform tasks unrelated to their job against their will.

Sexual harassment is illegal; we will seriously investigate relevant reports. If any employee is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated. We have active POSH guidelines in our offices in India, or equivalent in other countries, and we take these incidents very seriously. If you’re being harassed, whether by a colleague, customer, or vendor, you can choose to talk to any of these people:

- **Offenders.** If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realize they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly to resolve the harassment. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g., inappropriate jokes between colleagues.) Avoid using this approach with customers or stakeholders.
- **Your HR.** Feel free to contact your ICC/HR/Office of the CEO in any harassment case, no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact ICC/HR/Office of the CEO as soon as possible. If you want to contact us over text, please use the #hr-issues channel in Discord to file your complaint or email HR. Please remember that anything you disclose will remain confidential. Your HR will assess your situation and take action accordingly.
