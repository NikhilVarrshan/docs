Zemuria is committed to a workplace built on dignity, respect, and professionalism. Harassment in any form is unacceptable.

Harassment includes behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment, including but not limited to:

- Verbal, physical, or psychological abuse
- Sexual harassment or unwelcome advances
- Discriminatory remarks related to identity or beliefs
- Bullying, ridicule, intimidation, or deliberate exclusion
- Spreading rumors or sabotaging someone’s work

Sexual harassment is illegal and will be handled with zero tolerance.

**Reporting Harassment**

If you experience or witness harassment, you may report it to:

4. Your Manager
4. HR
3. POSH-ICC (where applicable)

Reports will be handled confidentially and without retaliation. Retaliation against any reporting individual is itself a serious violation.
