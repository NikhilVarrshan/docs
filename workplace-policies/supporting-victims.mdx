title: "Supporting Victims"
---

To support victims of workplace violence, we may:

- Cover relevant medical bills.
- Pay for mental health treatment if needed.
- Provide victims with our lawyer’s services to help them file lawsuits.

Get help early on. Seek help from others early on to mitigate conflicts. For example:

- If you experience conflicts with a colleague, ask your HR/Manager/Office of the CEO for advice before tensions escalate. If these conflicts persist, ask your Manager whether you could attend conflict resolution seminars with your colleague.
- If you are experiencing personal or work troubles, seek help from a mental health professional. Check with your insurance provider to determine whether they cover mental health services, or ask HR/Manager for information on our Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Your discussions will remain confidential.

Our organization's foundation is “Mutual Respect,” and we will not allow anyone to compromise this foundation.
