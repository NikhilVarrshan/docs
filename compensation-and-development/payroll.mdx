We will pay your agreed-upon compensation by checks, bank transfers, or cash by the first week of the following month. You should be diligent in clocking in and out and using our timesheet software so we can accurately calculate your pay.

To be eligible for payroll, you must have been present for at least 15 calendar days during that calculated month.

All staff on contract in India and the U.S. need to submit invoices before the payroll date to be eligible to be considered for payroll.

All contract staff in India must ensure their PAN number is correct to ensure all TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) compliance. The HR team will help you with important forms associated with your tax returns or any other necessary compliance, etc.
