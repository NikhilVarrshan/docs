title: "Sick Leave"
---

Per government norms, you are entitled to 12 sick days off in a year. For new team members who join in the middle of the company year, our sick leave is prorated based on your start date during your first year at Zemuria.

You can take sick leave to recover from short-term illness, injuries, mental issues, and other indispositions. If you have the flu or other contagious disease, please use your sick days.

If you become sick, inform your CoS, manager, and team and request sick leave through our Discord ticket tool. We insist that you rest and recuperate for a day before returning.

If you want to attend routine health care (e.g., doctor’s or dentist’s appointments), use your PTO or arrange a flexible work schedule.

Occasionally, we may ask you to submit a physician’s note or other medical certification, which will be verified by the Company's medical team, and complete a sick leave form. We will do this if you are absent for over three days of sick leave.

We encourage you to use your sick leaves throughout the year. Unused sick leaves are not rolled over, and you'll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days at the end of the company year on your next month's payroll. 100% attendance will be rewarded with an additional monetary bonus.

Exceeding the 12 sick leave days or taking unapproved sick leave/Holiday will result in a Loss of Payment (LOP) day. Please note that the maximum number of days you can take off in a year is 30 LOP.

All leave policies apply only to full-time contract staff and salaried employees of Zemuria. Interns and Apprentices are not covered, and all absences except official holidays are Loss of Pay.

Internal disciplinary procedures will be initiated if any granted leaves are found to be falsely claimed at any point during your employment, regardless of when they were taken. The leave will be removed, and the equivalent amount will be deducted from your next payroll.
