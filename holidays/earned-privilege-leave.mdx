title: "Earned/Privilege Leave"
---

From the 2024 company year, all full-time staff members of Zemuria will have 12 days of Earned/Privilege Leave after every 12 months of continuous employment.

Continuous employment refers to the period of continuous service inclusive of sick leaves, authorized paid-time offs, and loss of pay not less than thirty days in the aggregate.

For team members who join in the middle of the company year, earned/privilege leave is prorated based on their start date during their first year at Zemuria.

Your earned/privilege leave rolls over year to year (Carry-forward) with a maximum bank of 24 days at any time. If you are terminated without cause or resign from Zemuria with earned/privilege leaves in your bank, you'll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days (prorated at the time of your departure).

All leave policies apply only to full-time contract staff and salaried employees of Zemuria. Interns and Apprentices are not covered, and all absences except official holidays are Loss of Pay.

Internal disciplinary procedures will be initiated if any granted leaves are found to be falsely claimed at any point during your employment, regardless of when they were taken. The leave will be removed, and the equivalent amount will be deducted from your next payroll.
