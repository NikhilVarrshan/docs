title: "Paid time off(PTO)/Casual Leave"
---

Under government norms, you are entitled to 12 casual days off annually. You can choose to take these 12 days off at your convenience. You can take your PTO with us any time after your first month. Your PTO/Casual Leave time is prorated based on your start date during your first year at Zemuria.

If you want to use PTO, send a request on the ticket tool at least 48 hours before in Discord. You can take your leave if your manager, CoS, or the CEO approves.

We encourage you to use your time off throughout the year. Unused PTOs are not rolled over, and you'll be paid the monetary equivalent for those unused days at the end of the company year on your next month's payroll. 100% attendance will be rewarded with an additional monetary bonus.

Exceeding the 12 casual days or taking unapproved PTO/Holiday will result in a Loss of Payment (LOP) day. Please note that the maximum number of days you can take off in a year is 30 LOP.

All leave policies apply only to full-time contract staff and salaried employees of Zemuria. Interns and Apprentices are not covered, and all absences except official holidays are Loss of Pay.

Internal disciplinary procedures will be initiated if any granted leaves are found to be falsely claimed at any point during your employment, regardless of when they were taken. The leave will be removed, and the equivalent amount will be deducted from your next payroll.
