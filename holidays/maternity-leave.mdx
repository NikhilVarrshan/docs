title: "Maternity Leave"

Zemuria, regardless of whether it is full-time contract staff or salaried employees, does not discriminate in its maternity leave policy. All payments during maternity leave marked as 100% will be based on the previous three months of payroll, with any recent hike in payment in the last three months before the maternity leave is deferred until maternity leave ends and the team member returns to work.

### India 

To be eligible to apply for maternity leave, the mother should have worked with us for at least 80 working days in the past 12 months.

Upon verification of application and grant of maternity leave, a mother can take up to 26 weeks at 100% pay. Although the laws of India recommend a split of 8 weeks of pre-natal leave and 18 weeks of post-natal leave, we will leave it at your own discretion. The same leave policy will extend even if it's beyond two children.

All Adopting/Commissioning mothers can take up to 12 weeks of maternity leave at 100% pay.

In case of medical termination or accidental miscarriage, a mother can take 12 weeks of maternity leave at 100% pay. However, in this case, medical proof of miscarriage is required.

### U.S.A 

If you become a child's primary caregiver, you can take up to 16 weeks of leave at 100% pay. If you become the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks' leave at 100% pay. You may take an additional unpaid leave (LOP) as the primary or secondary caregiver. All parental leave must be taken within the first year of the child’s birth or placement.
