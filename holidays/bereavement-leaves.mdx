Losing a loved one is traumatizing. If this happens to you while you work with us, we want to support you and give you time to cope and mourn. You are entitled to a maximum of 5 days of paid leave for the same under your PTO/CL.

You may take your bereavement leave on consecutive/non-consecutive days to

- Arrange a funeral or memorial service.
- Attend a funeral or memorial service.
- Resolve matters of inheritance.
- Fulfill other family obligations
- Mourn.
- Travel long distances for funerals.

All leave policies apply only to full-time contract staff and salaried employees of Zemuria. Interns and Apprentices are not covered, and all absences except official holidays are Loss of Pay.

Internal disciplinary procedures will be initiated if any granted leaves are found to be falsely claimed at any point during your employment, regardless of when they were taken. The leave will be removed, and the equivalent amount will be deducted from your next payroll.
