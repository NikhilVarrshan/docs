When we terminate staff, we may provide references for those who leave in good standing, meaning that you shouldnâ€™t have been terminated for-cause. If you are laid off, you may receive references/recommendations. Please ask your manager.

If you resign, you may ask for references, and your manager has a right to oblige or refuse.
