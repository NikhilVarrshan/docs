**7. Termination of Employment**

**7.1 General Principles**

Termination of employment is a serious matter and will be handled exclusively by HR, in accordance with:

- applicable law,
- the employee’s employment agreement,
- internal due process requirements.

Managers may recommend termination but may not communicate or execute termination decisions.

**7.2 Termination for Cause**

Termination for cause may occur where an employee:

- breaches contractual obligations,
- engages in misconduct or illegal activity,
- violates Company policies,
- consistently fails to meet performance standards despite corrective action,
- causes reputational, financial, or operational harm.

Where required, HR will conduct an internal inquiry and provide the employee with an opportunity to respond before reaching a decision.

**7.3 Termination Without Cause**

- Termination without cause may occur due to business or operational reasons, including redundancy, restructuring, or role elimination.
- Where applicable, notice or pay in lieu of notice will be provided in accordance with contractual terms and applicable law.

Any transition assistance or support is provided at the discretion of the Company.

**7.4 Probation, Interns, and Contract Staff**

- Probationary employment terms are governed by individual employment agreements and applicable law.
- Interns, trainees, and contract staff are governed by the terms of their respective agreements.

This policy does not override statutory protections where applicable.
