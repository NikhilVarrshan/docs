title: "Termination"
---

Terminating staff is always unpleasant but sometimes necessary. If that happens, we want to ensure we act lawfully and respectfully. All employment is at will, and you may be asked to leave if your contract or employment is terminated.

Depending on the nature of your termination (for cause or without cause), you may be eligible for payouts and other compensation as described in your leave policies.

We may terminate staff either for cause or without cause.

- For-cause termination is justified when staff breaches their contract, engages in illegal activities (e.g., embezzlement), disrupts our workplace (e.g., harasses colleagues), insubordination, misconduct, performs below acceptable standards, or causes damage or potential damage to reputation or financial loss to our company.

All for-cause terminations will follow an internal disciplinary inquiry, with satisfactory evidence recorded. The employee will have a chance to appeal within 48 hours against the decision to prove that they're not guilty. At its discretion, the company will also allow additional time to prove that they're not guilty after the initial appeal. Company management's decisions are final.

All for-cause terminations are also eligible for their FnF (Full and Final settlement) according to the local laws and applicable employment policies of Zemuria, as well as an experience certificate that records their termination.

- Without-cause termination refers to redundancies or layoffs that may be necessary if we cease some of our operations or re-assign job duties within teams.

We may also help staff terminated without-cause find work elsewhere, if possible. We will also help without-cause termination with a glowing recommendation and a good experience certificate.

You'll be expected to complete all exit formalities, including general release of liabilities and other standard employment termination terms.

**For Managers:**

If you manage team members, avoid wrongful dismissal. When you terminate staff on a “for cause” basis, we expect you to be sure that you’re making the right choice with maximum accountability. We also require you to get permission from the Chief of Staff (CoS)/HR/Manager and keep accurate performance and/or disciplinary records to support your decision.

### India 

For all employment purposes, the first six months of your work at the company as a full-time contract staff member or a salaried employee are considered probation, and you can be terminated at will with no compensation, notice, or severance pay.

Interns and apprentices are not covered under this policy for all employment purposes, and they can be terminated at will with no compensation, notice, or severance pay.

All employees beyond their probation period with at least 6 months of continuous employment who undergo termination without-cause will be given a one-month notice of dismissal or one month's wages.

All Full-and-Final (FnF) settlements (or invites for settlement meetings) for terminated employees will be paid before the second working day of their termination or within two working days from receipt of the invoice (for contract staff). The FnF will involve all applicable deductions and the notice wages.
