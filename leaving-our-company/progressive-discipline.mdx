## Progressive discipline 

Here, we outline steps we will take to address staff misconduct. We want to allow staff to correct their behavior when possible and assist them. We also want to ensure that we thoroughly investigate and handle serious offenses. Our progressive discipline process has six steps of increasing severity. These steps are

- Step 01: Verbal warning
- Step 02: Informal meeting with supervisor
- Step 03: Formal reprimand
- Step 04: Formal disciplinary meeting
- Step 05: Penalties, Legal Action, AND OR Termination of employment.

Different offenses correspond to different steps in our disciplinary process. For example, minor, one-time offenses (e.g., Breach of our dress code policy) will trigger Step 1. More severe violations (e.g., Sexual harassment) will trigger Step 5.

If you manage staff, inform them when you launch a progressive discipline process.

Pointing out a performance issue is not necessarily a verbal warning and may be part of your regular feedback. If you judge that progressive discipline is appropriate, let your team member know and ask your CoS to help you explain our full procedure.

Management may skip or repeat steps at their discretion. Our company may treat circumstances differently from those described in this policy. However, we must always act fairly and lawfully and document every stage of our progressive discipline process. 

Remember that our company isn’t obliged to follow the steps of our progressive discipline process. We may terminate you directly without launching a progressive discipline process. For serious offenses (e.g., sexual harassment), we may terminate you without warning.
