title: "10.2 Progressive Discipline"
---

### **1. Objective**

The Company follows a corrective approach to employee conduct and performance wherever appropriate. Progressive discipline is intended to provide employees with an opportunity to understand concerns and improve their conduct or performance.

**Disciplinary Measures**

Depending on the nature and severity of the issue, disciplinary action may include one or more of the following:

- Verbal warning
- Informal counselling or discussion
- Written warning or formal reprimand
- Formal disciplinary meeting
- Penalties, suspension, or termination of employment

These steps are indicative and do not constitute a mandatory sequence. Not all situations warrant the same approach.

**Serious Misconduct**

In cases involving serious misconduct (including but not limited to harassment, fraud, violence, gross insubordination, confidentiality breaches, or illegal activity), HR may bypass intermediate steps and proceed directly to termination, subject to applicable law and due process requirements.

**Fair Process**

Employees will be informed when a disciplinary process is initiated. Disciplinary actions will be documented.

HR will ensure actions are proportionate, consistent, and legally compliant.
