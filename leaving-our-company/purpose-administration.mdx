**1. Purpose**

This policy sets out the Company’s framework for employee exits, including disciplinary action, resignation, termination, and references. The objective of this policy is to ensure that all exits are handled in a manner that is lawful, consistent, fair, and respectful, while protecting the Company’s operational, legal, and reputational interests.

This policy applies to all employees unless superseded by applicable law or specific provisions contained in an individual employment agreement.

**2. Authority and Administration**

Human Resources (HR) is responsible for the administration, interpretation, and enforcement of this policy.

HR has sole authority to:

- initiate and manage disciplinary processes,
- accept and process resignations,
- approve or reject notice period buyouts,
- determine and execute termination decisions,

ensure compliance with applicable law and Company procedures.

Managers may identify issues, document facts, and make recommendations; however, managers do not have authority to independently discipline, terminate employment, compel resignations, or determine notice period outcomes.
