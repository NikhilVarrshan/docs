### **1. Voluntary Resignation**

An employee may resign by submitting a written resignation to HR or their reporting manager.

An employee who fails to report to work for five (5) consecutive working days without notice or communication may be treated as having abandoned employment, subject to review by HR.

### **2. Notice Period**

Notice period obligations are governed exclusively by the employee’s employment agreement, offer letter, or subsequent contractual amendments.

This policy does not define, modify, or override contractual notice periods.

Employees are responsible for understanding and complying with their contractual notice obligations.

### **Transition and Handover**

Employees serving notice are required to:

- continue to perform assigned duties,
- complete knowledge transfer and documentation,
- return Company property,
- cooperate with transition requirements.

Failure to fulfil these obligations may impact final settlement and relieving date.
