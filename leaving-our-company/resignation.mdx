You resign when you voluntarily inform HR or your manager that you will stop working for our company. We also consider you resigned if you don’t come to work for five consecutive days without notice.

All types of employees are required to provide two weeks' notice, fulfill all employee obligations, and transfer knowledge before resigning. All managerial positions require a month’s Notice, fulfill all employee obligations, and transfer knowledge before resigning.

We prefer that you submit a written and signed notice of resignation for our HR records. We will reply with an acceptance of the resignation letter within two days. If you haven't already done so, the CoS/HR/Manager will inform the management that you are resigning. Whether you want to announce your resignation to your team is up to you, but we encourage you to be open.
