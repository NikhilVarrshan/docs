Forced Resignation (Prohibited Conduct)

The Company strictly prohibits forced or coerced resignations (constructive dismissal).

Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to:

- creating a hostile or intolerable work environment,
- pressuring or coercing an employee to resign,
- retaliation against an employee,
- imposing unofficial adverse actions (e.g., unjustified demotions or unreasonable workload) to compel resignation.

Any such conduct must be reported immediately to HR and will be treated as serious misconduct.
