title: "Forced Resignation"
---

You can resign at any time of your own free will, and nobody should force you to resign. Forcing someone into resigning (directly or indirectly) is constructive dismissal, and we won’t tolerate it and will submit it under misconduct. Employees are encouraged to report such behavior to management. 

Specifically, we prohibit staff from

- Creating a hostile or unpleasant environment.
- Demanding, campaigning against, or coaxing a staff to resign.
- Victimizing, harassing, or retaliating against staff.
- Forcing staff to resign by taking unofficial adverse actions (e.g., demotions, increased workload).
