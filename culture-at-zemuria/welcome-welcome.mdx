A very important preface (read this once)

**This document is not:**

•	an employment contract

•	an employee handbook

•	a company policy

•	a statutory or regulatory document

•	a substitute for HR policies, POSH, ICC, grievance mechanisms, or labour law

•	a performance evaluation framework

•	a disciplinary code

Zemuria’s official policies, employee handbook, statutory obligations, and grievance mechanisms exist independently and always apply, without exception.

This document does not override, modify, dilute, or replace any of them.

### **So what is this?**

This is a cultural manifesto.

It is written for:

•	founders-in-residence

•	venture builders

•	senior engineers

•	operators who voluntarily choose to work at extreme velocity

•	people who want disproportionate outcomes and are willing to accept disproportionate responsibility

This book is opt-in by mindset, not enforced by role. If this document resonates with you - good. If it doesn’t -  that’s fine too. Zemuria has room for many ways of working.

### **Why this exists**

Most companies hide their real culture behind polite language. We don’t.

This book exists to describe how a small group of people at Zemuria choose to operate when the goal is not comfort, balance, or predictability - but impact, speed, and creation. You are not required to live by this book. But if you do, the expectations are high - because the outcomes are high.

### **Eligibility (and non-eligibility)**

This culture is not granted. It is earned and maintained.

**Participation in this way of working:**

•	is explicit, not assumed

•	may be time-bound

•	may be revoked

•	does not create special employment rights or exemptions

No one is entitled to this culture. No one is punished for opting out of it.
