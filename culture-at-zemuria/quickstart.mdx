title: "The Five Laws of Z"
---

Everything that follows collapses into five principles.

They are not rules.

They are lenses.

### Law 1: Speed \> Everything Else

Urgency is not panic.

**Urgency is clarity.**

We move fast because:

•	markets move fast

•	customers don’t wait

•	reality compounds

If something feels slow, break it down.

If something feels blocked, remove friction.

If something feels heavy, question it.

Speed does not mean recklessness.

It means short feedback loops and relentless momentum.

### Law 2: Physics \> Process

**Reality always wins.**

Budgets, titles, opinions, and meetings do not bend physics.

We respect:

•	constraints

•	energy

•	effort

•	causality

Processes are tools - not laws.

If a process slows reality, it is optional.

If reality demands change, we adapt.

### Law 3: Work Done = Force × Displacement

Time spent is not work done.

Sitting longer is not progress.

Being visible is not impact.

**Work only counts when something moves:**

•	a product

•	a decision

•	a customer

•	a system

If nothing moved, work did not happen - regardless of hours logged.

### Law 4: Be Close to the Problem

Distance creates delay.

Delay kills velocity.

**We stay close to:**

•	customers

•	users

•	failures

•	production

If something is unclear, talk to the source.

If something is complex, reduce distance.

This is why proximity - physical or contextual - matters.

### Law 5: Engineering First

**Zemuria is an engineering-first company.**

That doesn’t mean everyone writes code.

It means everyone thinks in systems.

We value:

•	clarity over politics

•	solutions over sentiment

•	effectiveness over popularity

You are here to make things work.
