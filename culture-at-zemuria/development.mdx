### 1. On Work Location and flexibility

The office is a default, not a prison.

Presence matters when:

	•	collaboration matters

	•	decisions are being made

	•	problems are being solved together

Flexibility exists when:

	•	focus matters

	•	output is clear

	•	communication remains intact

No separate permissions are needed — only responsibility.

### **2. On time, hours, and autonomy**

We do not worship clocks.

We care about:

	•	outcomes

	•	momentum

	•	reliability

Some people will solve in fewer hours what others take longer to do.

We respect that.

Autonomy increases with trust.

Trust increases with results.

### **3. On accountability**

This culture comes with zero babysitting.

If you need constant supervision, this is not for you.

If you need rigid rules to function, this is not for you.

Ownership is assumed.

Excuses are not.

### **4. On alignment with official policy (read carefully)**

Nothing in this book:

	•	removes your right to report misconduct

	•	limits access to grievance mechanisms

	•	overrides POSH, ICC, HR, or statutory protections

	•	alters employment terms

	•	replaces official documentation

Those systems exist precisely so culture does not become coercion.

This book exists alongside, not above, them.
