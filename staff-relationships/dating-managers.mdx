title: "6.5 Relationships involving Manager's or Authority"
---

Relationships involving a manager and someone over whom they have direct or indirect authority present heightened risk.

### **Accordingly:**

- Any such relationship must be disclosed promptly to HR.
- A manager must not have authority over their partner’s hiring, appraisal, compensation, promotion, work allocation, or discipline.
- Structural mitigation (e.g., change in reporting line, recusal from decisions) will be mandatory where feasible.

If adequate separation is not possible, the Company may take appropriate action to mitigate risk, in accordance with applicable law.

Managers acting as hiring authorities must not interview, evaluate, or influence the hiring of their partner.
