Consensual relations with direct reports must be reported within 48 hours and are permitted only after approval. If management/HR does not approve them for any reason, they cannot work together in the same team.

If there are no other roles in other teams in which one of them could fit in, one of them will have to resign, or both of their employments will be impacted with a termination for cause. This policy, which ensures fairness and maintains a professional work environment for all, is backed by serious consequences for non-compliance.

If any relationship is permitted, it is permitted, provided no acts of favoritism and abuse of authority are found and/or reported.

If any such incidents are reported, a transfer or termination will occur based on the investigation.

This condition extends to every manager above an employee. Also, if you act as a hiring manager, you arenâ€™t allowed to interview your partner for your team.
