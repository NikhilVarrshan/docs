title: "Friendships at Work"
---

Staff who work together may naturally form friendships in or outside the workplace. We ask that you carefully weigh the pros and cons before entering any peer relationship, as it will impact your work.

We encourage maintaining a professional working environment and treating your colleagues with professional respect. This will help you grow in your career and develop strong judgment and decision-making skills without emotional bias.

It's important that we all focus on our work and keep personal disputes outside our workplace. This ensures productivity and a positive work environment. Any disputes that involve the workplace will be subjected to our internal disciplinary proceedings and compliances.
