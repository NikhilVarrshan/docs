### **1. Purpose**

While personal relationships may naturally arise in or around the workplace, the Company’s primary responsibility is to prevent conflicts of interest, protect confidentiality, ensure fairness, and comply with applicable laws.

This policy does not seek to regulate employees’ private lives. It applies only where personal relationships create, or may reasonably be perceived to create, a workplace risk.

This policy applies to:

- All employees (permanent, probationary, fixed-term)
- Interns, trainees, consultants, and contractors
- Managers, senior leadership, and hiring authorities

It applies to conduct:

- within Company premises,
- in shared buildings or common areas,
- during work-related travel or events,
- in work-related communications (including digital platforms),
- where external relationships may impact Company interests.
