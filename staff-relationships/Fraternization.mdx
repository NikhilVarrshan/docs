title: "Fraternization"
---

Fraternization, which includes dating or being friends with your colleagues, is a natural part of workplace dynamics. In this policy, we define “dating” as consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations.

We explicitly prohibit non-consensual relationships, which constitute sexual violence, to ensure a fair and respectful workplace for all. 

All relationships, including one-time sexual relationships, must be disclosed to the management within 48 hours of officialization. Additionally, if two people have had prior relations, they must disclose them to management.
