title: "Solicitation and Distribution"
---

Solicitation is requesting money, support, or participation for products, groups, organizations, or causes unrelated to our company (e.g., religious proselytism, asking for petition signatures.) Distribution means disseminating literature or material for commercial or political purposes.

We don’t allow solicitation and distribution by non-employees in our workplace. As an employee, you may solicit from your colleagues only when you want to:

- Ask colleagues to help organize events for another employee (e.g., adoption/birth of a child, promotion, retirement).
- Seek support for a cause, charity, or fundraising event our company sponsored, funded, organized, or authorized.
- Invite colleagues to employee activities for an authorized non-business purpose (e.g., recreation, volunteering.)
- Ask colleagues to participate in employment-related activities or groups protected by law (e.g., trade unions.) 

Please do not disturb or distract colleagues from their work, as we value and respect their contributions.
