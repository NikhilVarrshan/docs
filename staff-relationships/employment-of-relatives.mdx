title: "Employment of relatives"
---

At our company, we are committed to a culture of meritocracy. Everyone is hired, recognized, or promoted based on their skills, character, and work ethic. We have put restrictions in place to prevent nepotism, favoritism, or conflicts of interest, ensuring that all employees are valued for their contributions. 

To our company, a “relative” is someone related by blood or marriage within the third degree to an employee. This includes parents, grandparents, in-laws, spouses or domestic partners, children, grandchildren, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, step-parents, step-children, and adopted children. 

You can refer your relatives to work with our company as employees. However, here are our only restrictions:

- You must not be involved in a supervisory/reporting relationship with a relative.
- You cannot be transferred, promoted, or hired inside a reporting relationship with a relative.
- You cannot be part of a hiring committee when your relative is interviewed for that position.

If you become related to a manager or direct report after you both become employed by our organization, it must be disclosed to the management.
