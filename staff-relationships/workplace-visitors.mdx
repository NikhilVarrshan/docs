If you want to invite a visitor to our offices, please ask for permission from our HR, or your Manager first. Also, inform our reception/gate/front office of your visitor’s arrival. Visitors should sign in and show identification. They will receive passes and be asked to return them to the reception/ gate/front office once their visit is complete.

When you have office visitors, you also have responsibilities. You should

- Always tend to your visitors (especially when they are underage).
- It's essential to keep your visitors away from areas where confidential records are kept. This ensures the security of our sensitive information and protects your visitors from any unnecessary exposure.
- Prevent your visitors from proselytizing your colleagues, gathering donations, or requesting participation in activities on our premises.
- It's important to note that anyone who delivers orders, mail, or packages for staff should remain at our building’s reception or gate. If you are expecting a delivery, front office staff or security guards will notify you so you may collect it.

This policy ensures that all deliveries are handled efficiently and that you are always aware of incoming packages.
