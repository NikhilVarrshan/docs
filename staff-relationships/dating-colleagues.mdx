title: "Dating Colleagues"
---

If you start dating a colleague, maintain professionalism and keep personal discussions outside our workplace. You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We wonâ€™t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip, and improper comments. If you witness this behavior, please report it to HR/Manager.

All rules of fraternization apply to this section.

If colleagues dating each other create a specific conflict of interest, they cannot work together in the same team. If there are no other roles in other teams in which one could fit in, one of them will have to resign, or both of their employments will be impacted with a termination without cause. This policy ensures fairness and maintains a professional work environment for all.

If colleagues dating each other do not maintain all rules of professionalism, they'll be subjected to [<u>Progressive Discipline</u>](https://library.zemuria.com/2/handbook/80/progressive-discipline) or will impact their employment with a direct termination for cause depending on the severity of the event as decided by the HR/Manager or the Management.
