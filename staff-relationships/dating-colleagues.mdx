Personal relationships between colleagues are not prohibited.

However, employees must disclose a relationship only when it creates or may reasonably be perceived to create a workplace risk, including but not limited to:

- a reporting or evaluative relationship,
- influence over hiring, compensation, promotion, or discipline,
- access to sensitive or confidential information,
- disruption to team functioning or professionalism,
- complaints of favoritism, harassment, or retaliation.

Employees must:

- maintain professional conduct at work,
- avoid public displays of affection on Company premises,
- keep personal disputes outside the workplace,
- avoid inappropriate communication during work hours.

Failure to maintain professionalism may result in disciplinary action.
