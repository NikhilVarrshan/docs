title: "Staff relationships with other organizations"
---

If an employee begins a romantic involvement with an individual from another organization situated on the same premises/office building or with someone associated with a direct or indirect competitor, the employee must disclose the nature of the relationship promptly.

This includes any one-time sexual encounters or casual meetings such as dates. This disclosure must be made to the Human Resources (HR) department within 48 hours or sooner. This measure is necessary to mitigate and assess any potential legal implications both presently and in the future.

The same policy of disclosure within 48 hours or earlier applies to organizations, individuals, or companies that deal with us in any form or kind, including, but not limited to, vendors, clients, etc.

Any violation of this policy or our compliance will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.
