title: "Relationships with External Parties"
---

Employees may have personal relationships with individuals from other organizations. Disclosure is required when such relationships create a conflict of interest or confidentiality risk, including when the external party is:

- a competitor (direct or indirect),
- a portfolio company or its employees,
- a vendor, client, consultant, or partner,
- another tenant or service provider within shared premises.

**Employees must:**

- not share or discuss confidential or non-public information,
- avoid work-related discussions in common or public areas,
- ensure screens, calls, and documents are not visible or audible to outsiders,
- recuse themselves from decisions involving the external party where required.

The Company may implement mitigation measures such as access restrictions, reassignment, or recusal to protect its interests.
