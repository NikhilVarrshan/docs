### **6. Restricted Content**

Employees must not publish, without prior written approval:

- technical blogs derived from Company or portfolio systems,
- internal methodologies, architectures, or frameworks,
- non-public operational, strategic, or financial information,
- retrospectives or “how we built this” content relating to Company or portfolio work.

This applies regardless of platform or whether the blog is personal or monetized.

**6.1 Generic Content (Limited Allowance)**

Generic, non-confidential content may be permitted only where it:

- does not reference Company or portfolio specifics,
- does not rely on proprietary know-how,
- could reasonably be created without access to Company work,
- does not imply Company endorsement.

The Company reserves discretion to review or restrict such content.
