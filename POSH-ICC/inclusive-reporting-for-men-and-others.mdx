(Beyond POSH – Company Commitment)

### Important Clarification:

While the POSH Act statutorily applies to women complainants, Zemuria recognizes that:

Sexual harassment can be experienced by anyone, irrespective of gender.

Accordingly, the Company provides parallel, equally serious internal mechanisms for:

1. Men
2. Non-binary individuals
3. Gender-diverse employees
4. Any person not covered under POSH statutory scope

Employees who are not covered under POSH may report sexual harassment or sexually inappropriate conduct through the following channels:

1. Human Resources (HR)
2. Designated Ethics / Grievance Officer
3. Reporting Manager or Skip-Level Manager
4. Confidential grievance email or portal
5. Any member of senior management

**Such complaints will:**

- Be treated with the same seriousness and confidentiality
- Follow fair, impartial, and documented inquiry processes
- Be protected against retaliation
- Result in disciplinary action where misconduct is established

The absence of POSH statutory coverage does not reduce the Company’s obligation to act.

### HANDLING OF NON-POSH SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS

**For complaints raised by men or others:**

An **Internal Inquiry Committee **(separate from ICC or overlapping where appropriate) may be constituted

The inquiry will follow:

- Natural justice
- Right to be heard
- Evidence-based findings
- Proportional disciplinary action
- Possible actions include:
- Counseling or warning
- Suspension
- Termination
- Role change or restriction
- Any corrective or preventive measure deemed appropriate
