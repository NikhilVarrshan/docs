---

Each complaint of sexual harassment shall be dealt with utmost confidentiality and urgency by an internal committee:

**Composition of ICC**

- Presiding Officer: The senior-most woman employee of the organization.
- Two or more employees: with experience in social work(Internal members).
- One external member(legal expert): from an NGO or similar body familiar with POSH laws.
- Provided that at least 50% of the committee members nominated should be women.
- The ICC shall have a tenure of three years and will be responsible for receiving and addressing sexual harassment complaints.
- The integrity and effectiveness of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) are paramount in ensuring a robust and fair workplace harassment prevention mechanism. Disqualification of ICC members is a critical aspect of maintaining the highest standards of professional conduct, legal compliance, and organizational credibility.

**Disqualification of ICC Members**

- The foundation of ICC member disqualification centers on the principle of absolute impartiality and professional integrity. Any identified irregularities that undermine the investigation's credibility become grounds for immediate removal. These irregularities may manifest in various forms, including but not limited to deliberate bias, violation of confidentiality protocols, failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest, or actions that compromise the fundamental principles of fair and objective investigation.
- Conflict of interest represents the primary ground for member disqualification. Any direct or indirect personal, professional, or financial connection between ICC members and the parties involved in a complaint immediately compromises the investigation's objectivity. This encompasses familial relationships, previous professional interactions, existing or past reporting hierarchies, personal friendships, or any financial dependencies that could influence the investigation's outcomes.
- Professional and ethical standards form the cornerstone of ICC member qualification. Members demonstrating inappropriate behavior, favoritism, or hostility during proceedings, lacking comprehensive training in sexual harassment investigations, or if a member is found guilty of a criminal offense, particularly one involving moral turpitude, or having faced disciplinary actions within the organization, are automatically considered unsuitable. The committee members must exemplify unparalleled professional integrity, emotional intelligence, and an unwavering commitment to maintaining strict confidentiality.
- Building upon the robust ICC member selection and disqualification framework, the organization recognizes that an effective complaint mechanism is the cornerstone of workplace harassment prevention. Addressing workplace harassment begins with creating a safe, accessible, and supportive environment that empowers aggrieved individuals to come forward without fear of retaliation or secondary victimization.
