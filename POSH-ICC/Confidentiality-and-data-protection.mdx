All proceedings related to the case should be conducted with utmost confidentiality, and this report is shared with the employer in accordance with the POSH Act, 2013. The identities of the complainant, respondent, and witnesses should be kept confidential in line with Section 9 of the Act.

CONCLUSION:Â  Complaints relating to Sexual Harassment shall be handled and investigations will be conducted under the principles of natural justice, based on the principles of fundamental fairness, impartially and confidentially to protect the identity of all, viz. the person filing the charge, potential witnesses, and the person accused of improper behaviour. Also, all efforts shall be made to ensure objectivity and thoroughness throughout the investigation.

The identity and address of the aggrieved person, respondent, and witnesses must not be published or disclosed to the public or media.

The overarching philosophy of our approach is to create a safe, respectful, and professional work environment that protects employee rights, maintains organizational integrity, and promotes a culture of mutual respect and dignity.
