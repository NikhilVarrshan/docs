We want to provide practical advice to prevent careless social media use in our workplace. We address two types of social media use.

### **A. Using personal social media at work **

You are permitted to access your personal accounts at work. However, we expect you to act responsibly, according to our policies, and ensure that you stay productive. Specifically, we ask you to

- Discipline yourself and avoid getting sidetracked by your social platforms.
- Ensure others know that your account or statements don’t represent our company. For example, use a disclaimer such as “opinions are my own.”
- Avoid sharing intellectual property (e.g., trademarks) or confidential information. Avoid any defamatory, offensive, or derogatory content. Directing such content toward colleagues, clients, or partners may violate our company's anti-harassment policy.

### **B. Representing our company through social media **

If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:

- Be respectful, polite, and patient.
- Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible.
- Please follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe the laws governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism, and fair use.
- Coordinate with our PR/Marketing department when you’re about to share any major-impact content.
- Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason.
- Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.
