**A. Personal Social Media Use**

You may access personal social media accounts at work provided that:

- It does not affect productivity or performance
- Your views are clearly personal and not represented as company positions
- No confidential, proprietary, or internal information is shared
- No content is posted that is defamatory, discriminatory, or harassing toward colleagues, clients, founders, or partners
- Disclaimers such as “opinions are my own” do not override confidentiality obligations.

Misrepresentation or reputational harm caused through social media may result in disciplinary action.
