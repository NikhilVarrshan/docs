Email is essential to our work. You should use your company email primarily for work, but we allow some uses of your company email for personal reasons.

- **Work-related use:** You can use your corporate email for work-related purposes without limitations. For example, you can sign up for newsletters and online services that will help you in your job or professional growth.
- **Personal use:** While you can use your email for personal reasons, it's crucial to keep it safe. Avoid spamming and disclosing confidential information. For example, you can email friends and family and download eBooks, guides, and other safe content for personal use.

No matter how you use your corporate email, we expect you to avoid:

- Signing up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable, or suspect websites and services.
- Sending unauthorized marketing content or emails.
- Registering for a competitor’s services unless authorized.
- Sending insulting or discriminatory messages and content.
- Intentionally spamming other people’s emails, including your coworkers.

In general, use strong passwords and be vigilant about catching emails that carry malware or phishing attempts. If you are unsure whether an email you received is safe, remember that our Security Specialists are here to help.
