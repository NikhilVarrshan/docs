We allow the use of cell phones at work. But we also want to ensure that your devices won’t distract you from your work or disrupt our workplace. We ask you to follow a few simple rules:

- Use your cell phone in a manner that benefits your work (business calls, productivity apps, calendars.)
- Keep personal calls brief and use an empty meeting room or common area to avoid disturbing your colleagues.
- Avoid playing games on your phone or texting excessively.
- Avoid using your phone for any reason while driving a company vehicle. (Or any vehicle for that matter)
- Don’t use your phone to record confidential information.
- Don’t download or upload inappropriate, illegal, or obscene material using our corporate internet connection.
