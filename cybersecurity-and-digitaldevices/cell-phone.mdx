---

Zemuria permits the use of mobile phones and personal devices at work, subject to professional conduct and security expectations.

**Device Model**

Zemuria operates under a mixed device model:

- Some roles are issued company-owned devices
- Some roles operate under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) arrangements

Device assignment is determined by role, risk profile, and operational needs

**Usage Expectations**

You must:

- Use devices in a manner that supports work and does not disrupt others
- Keep personal calls brief and take them in appropriate areas
- Avoid excessive non-work usage during working hours
- Never record, photograph, or capture confidential information without authorization
- Never use a device while driving any vehicle for work purposes

All devices used for work - company-issued or personal - must comply with Zemuria’s security requirements, including password protection, encryption where required, and cooperation with security controls.
