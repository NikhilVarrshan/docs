Our corporate internet connection is primarily for business. But you can occasionally use our connections for personal purposes as long as they don’t interfere with your job responsibilities. Also, we expect you to temporarily halt personal activities that slow down our internet connection (e.g., uploading heavy files) if you’re asked to.

You must not use our internet connection to

- Download or upload obscene, offensive, or illegal material.
- Send confidential information to unauthorized recipients.
- Invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information.
- Download or upload pirated movies, music, material, or software.
- Visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise our network and computers’ safety.
- Perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud, or buying/selling illegal goods.
