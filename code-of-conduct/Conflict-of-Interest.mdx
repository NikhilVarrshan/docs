title: "Conflict of Interest"
---

When a conflict of interest arises, your personal objectives may diverge from your obligations to us. For instance, while accepting a bribe might seem advantageous to you, it's illegal and a violation of our business ethics.

If we become aware of such behaviors, you will be terminated and face legal trouble. For this reason, conflicts of interest are a severe issue for all of us. We expect you to be vigilant in spotting circumstances that create conflicts of interest for yourself or your direct reports.

Follow our policies and always act in our companyâ€™s best interests. Do not let personal or financial interests get in the way of your job whenever possible. If you are experiencing an ethical dilemma, talk to your HR or Manager, and we will help you resolve it.
