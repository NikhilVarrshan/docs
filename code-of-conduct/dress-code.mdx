title: "Dress Code"
---

Our company’s official dress code is Business/Business Casual/Smart Casual/Casual. This includes slacks/loafers/blouses/boots/shorts etc. However, an employee’s position may also inform how they should dress.

If you frequently meet with clients or prospects, conform to a more formal dress code. We expect you to be clean when coming to work. As long as you conform to our guidelines above, we don’t have specific expectations about what clothes or accessories you should wear.

We also respect and permit grooming styles, clothing, and accessories dictated by religious beliefs, ethnicity, or disability.
