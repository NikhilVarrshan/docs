title: "4.1 Workplace Neutrality, Dress Code & Identity Standards"
---

### 1. Purpose

Zemuria operates as a strictly professional, secular, and identity-neutral workplace.

Our objective is to ensure that all employees, clients, founders, partners, and visitors experience an environment defined solely by work, merit, professionalism, and mutual respect - free from religious, political, caste-based, tribal, or ideological influence.

This policy applies uniformly to all employees, contractors, interns, trainees, apprentices, visitors, and representatives of Zemuria.

### **2. Workplace Neutrality Principle**

Zemuria is a secular workplace.

This means:

- The company does not endorse, practice, promote, display, or facilitate any religion, belief system, political ideology, caste, tribe, or identity group.
- The workplace is not a venue for personal belief expression beyond private thought.
- No belief system - majority or minority - is given visibility, preference, or accommodation within company premises or official spaces.

This neutrality is foundational to ensuring equality, inclusion, and freedom from social pressure or symbolic dominance.

### **3. Dress Code (Professional & Neutral)**

**General Standard**

Zemuria follows a Business / Business Casual / Smart Casual dress code depending on role and context.
